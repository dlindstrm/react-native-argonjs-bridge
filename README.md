react-native-argonjs-starterkit
============

A [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [Webview Bridge](https://github.com/alinz/react-native-webview-bridge) example app that makes the geopose feature of [Argon](http://argonjs.io/) functional on both Android and iOS. It fetches the field of view (FOV) of the device camera through native modules, and sends it over a bridge to Argon. Developed to work together with [argon-three-starterkit](https://github.com/johankasperi/argon-three-starterkit).
